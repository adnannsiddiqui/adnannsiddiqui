# Hi, I’m Adnan 👋

🎓 **BBM Student @ Dr. Shantilal K Somaiya School of Commerce and Business Studies**  
💻 I code *crazy applications and products* that mix business thinking with tech experiments.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- Build **tiny apps** that solve oddly specific problems.
- Create **weird experiments** just to see if they work.
- Explore business + tech intersections to learn what people *actually* want.

---

## 🛠️ Currently Learning

- Frontend (Next.js, React)
- Backend basics (Node, Express)
- Python for automation and scraping
- Business modeling & how to sell what I build

---

## ⚡ Fun Fact

> I once tried to build a note-taking app in a single night. It barely worked, but I learned more than a week of theory.

---

## 🌱 Looking to Collaborate On

- Hackathons and idea sprints
- Building real micro-SaaS from scratch
- Fun experiments that challenge normal workflows
